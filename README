In this repo you find scripts to convert LSCP files to MIDNAM files.

There is also less interesting (personal) backup stuff from the openoctave project from the time they made use of Rosegarden as sequencer (pre-muse2-period)



HOW THE SCRIPT WORKS


* Read the README_scripts file!
* make a folder where you put the createDAWStudio.sh script and the list_of_files in
* make sure you've the  rgd2midnam.xsl and autoload.rg (~/.local/share/rosegarden/autoload/autoload.rg) on your system
* make sure the createDAWStudio.sh points to the right mounting point(s) and the right paths for the needed files
* make your midi mappings in several lscp files, using Fantasia GUI for Linuxsampler (see example FCH-AltoSax.lscp)
* put your lscp files in a folder and put the path in the list_of_files file
* See also the Final example lscp file in the repo
